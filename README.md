## Module Objective 
Students will learn and apply the systematic steps that anthropologists would take to make deductible inferences about historical societies given the observations of fossil (foot print) records. The goals of the module are a subset of tasks that help achieve this primary objective.

## Student Learning Objectives
1. Calculate the relationship between step length, cadence, and speed of walking in a population of undergraduate students. (Identify that anatomy and movement/kinematics are related.)
2. Compare them to that of G1 (hominin) to see if they are significantly different.
3. Explore the relationship between kinematics, fossil evidence, and behavior.
4. Apply data science techniques to analyze and interpret data in anthropology.

## Module Description
This module is used to learn and apply the systematic steps that anthropologists would take to make deductible inferences about historical societies given the observations of fossil (foot print) records.

### Data
Students collect data on their own footprints.

### Platform
Students use google forms to collect data and the instructor uses python to create visualizations.

## Course Information
This module is used in two courses <a href="http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-6">Introduction to Biological Anthropology (ANTH 06)</a> and <a href="http://dartmouth.smartcatalogiq.com/current/orc/Departments-Programs-Undergraduate/Anthropology/ANTH-Anthropology/ANTH-40">Human Functional Anatomy</a>. For ANTH 06, this is a 1st year course, and students are not expected to have any prior knowledge in anthropology. For ANTH 40, which is a 3rd/4th year course, students are expected to have taken some prior courses in anatomy and biology. However, for both courses, students should have basic skills in taking measurements, recording data, applying simple formulas to data, and reading graphs. Students are expected to make inferences, but are encouraged to use intuition and their belief.
